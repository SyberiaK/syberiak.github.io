[INCS2bot](https://github.com/aquaismissing/INCS2bot) (formelly known as CSGOBeta Bot) was firstly introduced in 2021 by [Aquarius](https://github.com/aquaismissing) as a way to track the activity of CS:GO developers. (This included monitoring changes to depots and the workshop, tweets from the official @CounterStrike account, and the number of developers playtesting a secret branch, presumably "Counter-Strike: Source 2.") The bot also notifies users about potential game updates.
INCS2bot consists of a tracker bot and a standard Telegram bot, providing various data such as *overall game server status*, *current game version*, *profile info and game stats for specific users* and *guns database*.

Prior to the announcement of Counter-Strike 2 Limited Test, I contacted Aqua to help in implementing a localization system so the bot could support more than two languages.

Fun fact: initially I wasn't planning to maintain this bot entirely! We planned that so the main codebase will be rewritten by another person, however after waiting 3 to 4 months without almost no progress, I simply lost patience and decided to rewrite it myself.

On August 2nd, 2023, the bot was rebranded to INCS2bot and made public. Since then, it has got some new functionalities, like language settings and CS2 Premier leaderboards overview and we still keep working on more interesting and useful features.

Putting things together, especially at launch, felt like a wild ride on the moving train being constructed. Although, as my first actual project being released, I feel satisfied with the result and the experience I gained.
